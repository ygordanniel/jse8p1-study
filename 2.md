# Chapter 2 Working with Java types

## 2.1 DECLARING AND INITIALIZING VARIABLES

* Declaration **MUST** be `type` followed by `name`. Ex: `int age`;
* Initialization, inside methods, is a **MUST** if you want to use the variable;
* Use variable that was not initialized -> compilation error;
* Class variables are *implicit initialized* with default value when the class is instanciated;
* Array creation too do *implicit initialization*;
* Default values:
    * Integer numbers: **0**
    * Float numbers: **0.0**
    * Boolean: **false**
    * Char: **empty**
    * References: **null**

### Primitive types

* All primitive types are already defined. Can't create new primitives types;
* `char` is `int`;
* Integer variables size:
    * byte ─ 1 byte (8 bits, de -128 a 127);
	* short	─ 2 bytes (16 bits, de –32.768 a 32.767);
	* char ─ 2 bytes (**só positivo**), (16	bits, de 0 a 65.535);
	* int ─	4 bytes	(32	bits, de –2.147.483.648	a 2.147.483.647);
	* long ─ 8 bytes (64 bits, de – 9.223.372.036.854.775.808 a 9.223.372.036.854.775.807);
* Floating variables size:
    * float	─ 4	bytes (32 bits,	de +/–1.4 * 10 ^ 45 a +/– 3.4028235 * 10 ^ 38);
	* double ─ 8 bytes (64 bits, de +/–4.9 * 10 ^ 324 a+/–1.7976931348623157 *	10 ^ 308);
* FLoating types can be `+/- infinity`, `+/- 0`, `NaN`;

### Literals

* Values that are direct on source code;
* All values bigger than `int` can be literals;
* Non primitives values can't be literals;
* Literal double value: `123123123123d`;
* Literal long value: `123123123123L`;

### Diferent bases

* Java suports Octal, Hexadecimal and binary on literal declaration;
* Octal **MUST** start with 0 followed by 0 to 7;
* Hexadecimal **MUST** start with 0x/0X followed by 0 to 9/A to F;
* Binary **MUST** start with 0b/0B followed by 0 or 1; 

### Scientific notation

* `double d = 3.1E2`;
* `double d = 3.1e2`;

### Underlines

* `int a = 123_456_789`;
* Can only be used between numbers;

### Initializing chars

* `char c = 'A'`;
* `char c = 65`;
* `char c = \u03A9` unicode;

### Identifiers

* Identifiers -> used by coder to identify methods, variables, classes...
* Reserved words -> terms defined by the language, **NONE** has uppercase word;
* Uncommon reserved words: `assert`, `goto`, `native`, `strictfp`, `synchronized`, `transient`, `volatile`; 
* Identifiers: can use words, numbers, $ or _. First word **CANNOT** be a number. Is case sensitive;

## 2.2 OBJECT-REFERENCING VARIABLES AND PRIMITIVE TYPES

### PRIMITIVES vs OBJECTS 

* Primitive store values;
* Objects store references;
* if object a = b and b.var = 5. a.var is 5 as well;

### REFERENCES 

* Two references are only equal if they `both` point to the same object;

### Exercises

2. f;

## 2.3 READ/WRITE OBJECT FIELDS

* To access an object's atribute we use `.` followed by the name of the referencing variable;
* When inside a class, no operator is necessary for accessing fields;
* keyword `this` works as a reference to the object itself;

### Exercises

1. d;

## 2.4 EXPLAIN OBJECT LIFE CYCLE

### Creation of objects

* `new` creates a new, in memory, instance of an object;
* A varaible is a simple reference to the object not the object itself;

### Accessible objects

* An object is accessible if you can *reach* it using a direct or indirect reference;
* `Lists` are an example of indirect reference;

### Unaccessible objects

* If there is no direct or indirect reference to an object it means that that object is unaccessible;

### Garbage Collector

* Every unaccessible object is eligible to the *garbage collector*;

#### Eligible objects x Collected objects

* The *Garbage Collector* runs in background with you java application;
* You **CAN'T** predict when it will be executed so you **CAN'T** tell for sure how much objects were effectively collected at a certain point;
* We con only tell how much objected are eligible to be collected;

### IMPORTANT - STRING LITERAL IS AN INSTANCIATED OBJECT

## 2.5 CALL METHODS IN OBJECT

* Methods signed with `void` does not have a return so can't be passed as parameter to another method or attributed to a variable;

### Variables arguments: varargs

* Since Java 5 `varargs` enables a method to recive a variable number of parameters. Ex: `int... nums`;
* `varargs` **ALWAYS** is an array;
* `varargs` **MUST** always be the last parameter of the method signature to avoid ambiguities which means that a method can only have, at most, **ONE** `varargs` on your signature;
* You can pass an array to an `varargs` parameter but you can't pass an `varargs` to an array parameter;

## 2.6 MANIPULAT DATA USING THE CLASS STRINGBUILDER AND IT'S METHODS;

* To suport mutable `Strings` Java has the classes `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`;
* `append` is the basic operation, it allows you to concatenate to the same object;
* `append` doesn't return a new object but alter the object itself;
* Usable constructors:
    * `StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder();` - empty;
    * `StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder("java");` - initial content;
    * `StringBuilder sb3 = new StringBuilder(50);` - array's initial length to store a string;
    * `StringBuilder sb4 = new StringBuilder(sb2);` - base on other object of the same type;
* **CAUTION** by defining the array size we are not creating a defined `String` size;
* `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` implements the same interface but only the first one is *thread-safe*;

### StringBuilder and StringBuffer main methods

* `append` has overloads to recive all the primitive types, `String`, char's arrays, other `StringBuffers` and etc, all of them returns the `StringBuffer/Builder` itself allowing to chained calls;
* `append` has an overload that recives an `Object` and uses the `toString` method to append the value of the object;
* `insert` to append a value to in any position, the first param is the index where we want to insert the value. Ex: `sb.insert(3, "some value")`;
* `delete` recives the initial and final index. Ex: `sb.delete(1, 10)`;
* To convert a `StringBuffer/Builder` into a `Stirng` simply call the `toString` method;
* `reverse` inverts its content;
* There is also the methods `trim`, `charAt`, `length`, `equals`, `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf` and `substring`;
* **CAUTION** `substring` does not change the value of the object;

## 2.7 CREATING AND MANIPULATING STRING

* `"Java"` - implicit way to create an String. `new String("Java")` - explicit way;
* You can also create a String from a array of chars or based on a `StringBuffer/Builder`;
* **STRING ISN'T A PRIMITIVE TYPE**;
* Concatanate `String` with `+`. If concatenate `null` to a `String` `null` is converted to `String`;
* Java converts primitive types to `String` automatically;
* Remember the operators precedence. `15 + 1 + " string"` = `"16 string"`;

### String are imutable

* Every method that seens to modify a `String` actually returns a new one;
* `String`, on backgroud, has an array of `chars`;

### String's main methods

* `length` - `String` size;
* `isEmpty` - `String` size equals 0;
* Returns a new `String`:
    * `toUpperCase()`;
    * `toLowerCase()`;
    * `trim()` - removes empty spaces of both ends;
    * `substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)` - Does not include the final position char but includes the initial position char;
    * `substring(int beginIndex)`;
    * `concat(String)`;
    * `replace(char oldChar, char newChar)` - replaces all occurences of `oldChar` for `newChar`;
    * `replace(CharSequence	 target, CharSequence replacement)`;
* Comparation: 
    * `boolean equals(Object)` - compare each char equality;
    * `boolean equalsIgnoreCase(String)` - same as `equals` but ignores `char` case;
    * `int compareTo(String)` - compare 2 `Strings` by lexicographic order;
    * `int compareToIgnoreCase(String)` - same as `compareTo` but ignore `char` case;

# Chapter 2 Working with Java types

## 2.1 DECLARING AND INITIALIZING VARIABLES

* Declaration **MUST** be `type` followed by `name`. Ex: `int age`;
* Initialization, inside methods, is a **MUST** if you want to use the variable;
* Use variable that was not initialized -> compilation error;
* Class variables are *implicit initialized* with default value when the class is instanciated;
* Array creation too do *implicit initialization*;
* Default values:
    * Integer numbers: **0**
    * Float numbers: **0.0**
    * Boolean: **false**
    * Char: **empty**
    * References: **null**

### Primitive types

* All primitive types are already defined. Can't create new primitives types;
* `char` is `int`;
* Integer variables size:
    * byte ─ 1 byte (8 bits, de -128 a 127);
	* short	─ 2 bytes (16 bits, de –32.768 a 32.767);
	* char ─ 2 bytes (**só positivo**), (16	bits, de 0 a 65.535);
	* int ─	4 bytes	(32	bits, de –2.147.483.648	a 2.147.483.647);
	* long ─ 8 bytes (64 bits, de – 9.223.372.036.854.775.808 a 9.223.372.036.854.775.807);
* Floating variables size:
    * float	─ 4	bytes (32 bits,	de +/–1.4 * 10 ^ 45 a +/– 3.4028235 * 10 ^ 38);
	* double ─ 8 bytes (64 bits, de +/–4.9 * 10 ^ 324 a+/–1.7976931348623157 *	10 ^ 308);
* FLoating types can be `+/- infinity`, `+/- 0`, `NaN`;

### Literals

* Values that are direct on source code;
* All values bigger than `int` can be literals;
* Non primitives values can't be literals;
* Literal double value: `123123123123d`;
* Literal long value: `123123123123L`;

### Diferent bases

* Java suports Octal, Hexadecimal and binary on literal declaration;
* Octal **MUST** start with 0 followed by 0 to 7;
* Hexadecimal **MUST** start with 0x/0X followed by 0 to 9/A to F;
* Binary **MUST** start with 0b/0B followed by 0 or 1; 

### Scientific notation

* `double d = 3.1E2`;
* `double d = 3.1e2`;

### Underlines

* `int a = 123_456_789`;
* Can only be used between numbers;

### Initializing chars

* `char c = 'A'`;
* `char c = 65`;
* `char c = \u03A9` unicode;

### Identifiers

* Identifiers -> used by coder to identify methods, variables, classes...
* Reserved words -> terms defined by the language, **NONE** has uppercase word;
* Uncommon reserved words: `assert`, `goto`, `native`, `strictfp`, `synchronized`, `transient`, `volatile`; 
* Identifiers: can use words, numbers, $ or _. First word **CANNOT** be a number. Is case sensitive;

### Exercises

1. d
2. a
3. d
4. f
5. b
6. b
7. a
8. c
9. e
10. d;

## 2.2 OBJECT-REFERENCING VARIABLES AND PRIMITIVE TYPES

### PRIMITIVES vs OBJECTS 

* Primitive store values;
* Objects store references;
* if object a = b and b.var = 5. a.var is 5 as well;

### REFERENCES 

* Two references are only equal if they `both` point to a single object;

## 2.3 READ/WRITE OBJECT FIELDS

* When inside a class, no operator is necessary for accessing fields;
* keyword `this` works as a reference to the object itself;

## 5.1 Creating and using While loops

* just like the `Ã¬f`, the `while` condition must be boolean
* the compiler does not allow for infinite loops except...
* except for when the condition variable is not final, the compiler has no way of knowing that it could result in an endless loop
* unreachable code: compile error
 
## 5.2 for loop and enhanced for

* initialization, condition, commands and updates 
* you can declare multiple variables: `for (int i = 1, j = 2, k = 3;;)`
* you **cannot** declare multiple variable types, but...
* you can iniciate multiple types of variables.
* there is no way to know where we are in the iteration when using the enhanced for
* you **can't modify** the collection values through the iterator
* you **can't go through** two collections at once with **one iterator**

## Do-while loops

* the condition is tested only after the body is executed
* there is a ';' after the condition : `do{ ... } while(1<10);`

## Comparing loops

* while and do while are very similar
* the simple for is more powerful than the Enhanced for 
* the enhanced for can't: run through more then one collection at once, remove elements, initialize arrays
* for reading purposes only, the enhanced for is the best option 
* we usually use `for` when we know the ammount of times we want the loop to be executed
* we use `while` and `do while` when we don't know the number of iterations 

## Using Break and Continue

* we can apply `break` and `continue` in any loop structure
* `break` stops the loop completely 
* `continue` interrupts only the current iteration and goes back to the condition
* break stops the lopp while continue forwards one iteration
* loops with an endless loop and a break does compile, be careful. 
* using continue in a for, do not skip to the condition before updating first 

## labeled loops

* You can create labeled statements
* `example: `// label 
  `for (int i=0...`
* we can use these labels to reference a loop we wish to break or continue
* a label may be present before a statement, but we can only use break or continue in a for, while or switch

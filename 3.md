# Chapter 3 USING OPERATORS AND DECISION'S CONSTRUCTORS

## 3.1 USE JAVA'S OPERATORS

* **attribution operator**, `=`, store a value to a variable;
* `byte < int < long < float < double`;
* `char` has the same size as `byte` but can't be negative;

### Reference and attribution

* attributions are **ALWAYS** by value copy, on primitive types we copy the value, on object reference we copy the reference (we do not duplicate the object);

### Arithmetic operators

* Used to do operations on numeric primitive variables: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%`;
* The type of the result variable from the operation is the most embracing type or, at least, `int`;

### Division by zero

* Divide an integer by zero will result on a `ArithmeticException`;
* Divide an float/double by zero will result on a positive/negative infinity;
* `NaN` *(Not a Number)* is generated by the radiciation of some numbers and by some operations with infinity numbers;

### Comparation operators

* Equality operators: `==` and `!=`;
* Order operators: `>`, `<`, `>=` and `<=`;
* A comparation only returns `true` or `false`;
* Numeric comparations ignores the value type;
* References and `boolean` can only be compared with `==` or `!=`;
* Can't compare incompatible types;
* Operations with floating number are not always accurated;

### Logic Operators

* And `&`, Or `|`, Exclusive Or `^`, Negation `!`;
* Short circuit operators: `&&` and `||`;

### Increment and Decrement operators

* Pos Add 1 `i++`;
* Pos Subtract 1 `i--`;
* Pre Add 1 `++i`;
* Pre Subtract 1 `--i`;
* Attributions and operations:
  * `i = i + 2` is the same as `i += 2`;
  * `i = i - 2` is the same as `i -= 2`;
  * `i = i * 2` is the same as `i *= 2`;
  * `i = i / 2` is the same as `i /= 2`;
  * `i = i % 2` is the same as `i %= 2`;
  * On this cases the compilator allows you to do oparations with incompatible types. Ex: `byte b1 = 3; b1 += 4;`;

### Ternary operator

* `boolean condiction ? if_true : if_false`;
* Should always return a value that can be used to an attribution;

### Reference operators

* `.`
* Used to navegate on an object;

### Strings concatenation

* Can use the operator `+` to concatenate `String`;
* `String` is the only class that accepts an operator besides `.`;
* String concatenation with `+` is a syntax sugar, once the code is compiled it uses a `StringBuilder`;

### Precedence

* Order of execution:
  1. pre increment/decrement
  2. multiplications, divisions and mod;
  3. subtraction addition;
  4. shifts;
  5. pos increment/decrement;

### Casting of primitive types

* `double d = 0; float f = (float) d`;
* Casting with primitive types can result on precision lost;

## 3.1 USE PARENTHESES TO OVERRIDE OPERATORS PRECEDENCES

* `int a = 15 * 4 + 1; // 15 * 4 = 60, 60 + 1 = 61`;
* `int b = 15 * (4 + 1); // 4 + 1 = 5, 15 * 5 = 75`;

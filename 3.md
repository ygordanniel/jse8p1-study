# Chapter 3 USING OPERATORS AND DECISION'S CONSTRUCTORS

## 3.1 USE JAVA'S OPERATORS

* **attribution operator**, `=`, store a value to a variable;
* `byte < int < long < float < double`;
* `char` has the same size as `byte` but can't be negative;

### Reference and attribution

* attributions are **ALWAYS** by value copy, on primitive types we copy the value, on object reference we copy the reference (we do not duplicate the object);

### Arithmetic operators

* Used to do operations on numeric primitive variables: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%`;
* The type of the result variable from the operation is the most embracing type or, at least, `int`;

### Division by zero

* Divide an integer by zero will result on a `ArithmeticException`;
* Divide an float/double by zero will result on a positive/negative infinity;
* `NaN` *(Not a Number)* is generated by the radiciation of some numbers and by some operations with infinity numbers;

### Comparation operators

* Equality operators: `==` and `!=`;
* Order operators: `>`, `<`, `>=` and `<=`;
* A comparation only returns `true` or `false`;
* Numeric comparations ignores the value type;
* References and `boolean` can only be compared with `==` or `!=`;
* Can't compare incompatible types;

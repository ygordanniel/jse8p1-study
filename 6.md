# Chapter 6 - Working with Methods and Encapsulation 

## 6.1 Create methods with arguments and return values 

* all non-abstract methods must possess a body 
* signature modifiers: `final, abstract, static, sinchronized, native, strictfp,throws <EXCEPTIONS>`
* there are no default value for parameters, all must be included 
* the only valid modifier for a parameter is `final`, and it's good practice to use it.
* passing any primitive type that is more restrictive than the expected one, will cast it to the expected type
* we can omit the return in void mothods
* void methods can have early returns 
* A method that isn't `void` must return something or throw an `exception`
* methods with a return value can be called without returning to a specific variable
* void methods can't be called upon a variable


## 6.2 Apply the static keyword to methods and fields

* `static` means the attribute belongs to the class, not the instance 
* `static` class methods can be called without instances 
* instance attributes that are not static, can't be used in static context (`Compile error`)
* static variables can access static methods
* a class can't have a static and a non-static method with the same signature 
* `this` keyword can't be used in a static context   


## 6.3 Create Overloaded Methods 

* java decides wich method to call in compile time
* overloaded methods may or may not have similar return types and visibility 
* overloaded methods **must have** different signatures 
* when overloading with polymorphism the compiler picks the most specific to execute (i.e the compiler will choose a `String` over `Object method`)
* if we wish to force the most generic method to be executed, we must cast
* the compiler can distinguish a method with an `Int` and a `double` when args are "`1,1.0`"
* the compiler cannot distinguish when the args are "`1,1`". It can't identify wich is an int or a double.

# Chapter 1

## 1.1 	DEFINE VARIABLE SCOPE

### Local variables

* Local variables dies at the end of the closing;
* Method's params are binded to the method scope;
* Try to use local variables or method params variables outside of its scope -> Compilation Error;

### Instance variables

* Object variables, fields, can be accessed as long as the object instance exists;

### Static variables

* Are shared between all classes' instances;
* Defined by the modifier `static`. Ex: `static int count = 15`;
* Can be accessed through class reference or class instance;


### Same name variables

* On the same scope, 2 variables can't be declared with the same name -> Compilation error;
* *Shadowing* - variables with same name but diferent scopes;
* Smaller to bigger scope;

## 1.2 DEFINE JAVA CLASS STRUCTURE

### Packages

* If package not declared the class is on `default package`;
* Package must be the first thing declare on the class;

### Classes

* Constructor may not be public;

### Variables

* Declaration: `type` + `name`;
* Instance variables -> has a copy for each object;
* Shared value for all instances of the class -> static variable;

### Methods

* Method signature -> name + params;
* Methods can be `static`;

### Constructors

* Constructor doesn't have return and has the same name as the class;

### Interfaces

* Methods should be declares without implementation;
* Constants can be declared on interfaces;

### Multiples structures for an archive

* Achive can have more than one class/interface;
* Can be defined in any order;
* If there is a public class/interface the archive **MUST** have the same name;
* There should be at most one public class/interface;
* If there isn't any public class/interface the archive can have any name;

# Chapter 1

## 1.1 	DEFINE VARIABLE SCOPE

### Local variables

* Local variables dies at the end of the closing;
* Method's params are binded to the method scope;
* Trying to use local variables or method params variables outside of its scope -> Compilation Error;

### Instance variables

* Object variables/fields can be accessed as long as the object instance exists;

### Static variables

* Shared between every instance of the class;
* Defined by the modifier `static`. Ex: `static int count = 15`;
* Can be accessed through class reference or class instance;


### Same name variables

* Multiple variables can't be declared with the same name at the same scope -> Compilation error;
* *Shadowing* - variables with same name but diferent scopes;
* Variables are accessed from smaller(closest scopes) to bigger scopes;

## 1.2 DEFINE JAVA CLASS STRUCTURE

### Packages

* When a package is not declared, it's automatically set to `default package`;
* A Package must be the first thing declared on the class, followed by imports;

### Classes

* A Constructor may not be public, if so, it can only be accessed from within the Class;

### Variables

* Declaration: `type` then `name`;
* Instance variables -> variables with exclusive value for each object instanciated;
* Static variableShared -> variables with value shared between every instance of the class;

### Methods

* Method signature -> name + params;
* Methods can be `static`;

### Constructors

* Constructors doesn't return anything, and must be named the same as its class;

### Interfaces

* Methods should be declared without implementation;
* methods with the `default modifier` must be implemented, though. 
* Constants can be declared on interfaces;

### Multiples structures for an archive

* An archive can have more than one class/interface;
* classes and interfaces can be placed in any order;
* If there is a public class/interface the archive **MUST** have the same name;
* There should be at most one public class/interface;
* If there isn't any public class/interface, the archive name may vary;

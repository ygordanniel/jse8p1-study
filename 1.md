# Chapter 1

## 1.1 	DEFINE VARIABLE SCOPE

### Local variables

* Local variables dies at the end of the closing;
* Method's params are binded to the method scope;
* Trying to use local variables or method params variables outside of its scope -> Compilation Error;

### Instance variables

* Object variables/fields can be accessed as long as the object instance exists;

### Static variables

* Shared between every instance of the class;
* Defined by the modifier `static`. Ex: `static int count = 15`;
* Can be accessed through class reference or class instance;


### Same name variables

* Multiple variables can't be declared with the same name at the same scope -> Compilation error;
* *Shadowing* - variables with same name but diferent scopes;
* Variables are accessed from smaller(closest scopes) to bigger scopes;

## 1.2 DEFINE JAVA CLASS STRUCTURE

### Packages

* When a package is not declared, it's automatically set to `default package`;
* A Package must be the first thing declared on the class, followed by imports;

### Classes

* A Constructor may not be public, if so, it can only be accessed from within the Class;

### Variables

* Declaration: `type` then `name`;
* Instance variables -> variables with exclusive value for each object instanciated;
* Static variableShared -> variables with value shared between every instance of the class;

### Methods

* Method signature -> name + params;
* Methods can be `static`;

### Constructors

* Constructors doesn't return anything, and must be named the same as its class;

### Interfaces

* Methods should be declared without implementation;
* methods with the `default modifier` must be implemented, though;
* Constants can be declared on interfaces;

### Multiples structures for an archive

* An archive can have more than one class/interface;
* classes and interfaces can be placed in any order;
* If there is a public class/interface the archive **MUST** have the same name;
* There should be at most one public class/interface;
* If there isn't any public class/interface, the archive name may vary;

## 1.3 EXECUTABLE APPLICATIONS AND COMMAND-LINE

### Main Method

* Executable classes must have a `main` method;
* `main` method must have public and static modifiers in any order;
* `main` must return void;

### Commandline

* passing parameters through command line: `java myClassName arg1 arg2...`;

### Compiling and Executing 

* `javac` command generates bytecode;
* `java`command invokes the virtual machine to execute a java program;
* `jar -cf name.jar packagename` to create the jar file;
* `java -cp name.jar packagename.classname` to run jar file;
* Add `Main-Class: package.classname`  to `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` to point main method to a jar file;
* `jar -cfm bib.jar mymanifest package` to send a custom manifest to a jar file;

## 1.4 Importing Packages 

* *Full Qualified Name*: package name followed by class name;
* Classes, by default, can only be acessed from their own package;
* Classes with the `public` modifier can be accessed by other packages;
* packages, then imports, then class definition;
* reserved word `import` followed by FQN;
* FQN must be used when importing classes with the same name from different packages ;
* specific imports have priority over generic imports;
* Classes in the default package can only be imported from the default package;
* Package names, by convention, should be lowercase. (site.company.project.etc);
* `import static` imports static methods and variables from a class;
* We must access packages directly, there are no subpackages;
